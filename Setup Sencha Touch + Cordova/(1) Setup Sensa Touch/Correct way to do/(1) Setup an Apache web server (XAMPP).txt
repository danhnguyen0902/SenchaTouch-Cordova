Errors that we could run into:
"Apache shutdowns unexpectedly"
"mySQL shutdowns unexpectedly"

Solutions:
a. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18300377/xampp-apache-error-apache-shutdown-unexpectedly
OR
b. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1m56HZRwuk

(I used a., then I installed UniServer (WAMP), then I used b., but the localhost didn't work, so I unistalled UniServer (simply deleted everything), undo everything I did in b. ---> It worked again)
UniServer (WAMP) can cause that problem. In short, don't install UniServer, and use a. is enough!

AUTHENTICATION I use:
