"Native applications on mobile devices have access to device components such as the compass, and microphone[3] which Sencha Touch can access through the use of a native shell such as Cordova."

-----> used for Hybrid apps


However:

"Sencha Touch can be used along with Cordova or Phonegap or its own native packager, to create applications native to a mobile device that have access to currently native-only components, and which can be made available from app marketplaces."



"As of Sencha Touch 2.3, Cordova is the favored packaging technology."
